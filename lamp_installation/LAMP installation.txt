3. Install LAMP Components
Update the System:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
Install Apache:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install apache2 -y
Start Apache:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start apache2
Enable Apache to Start on Boot:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable apache2
Install MySQL:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install mysql-server -y
Secure MySQL Installation: Run the MySQL security script and follow the prompts to secure your MySQL installation:

bash
Copy code
sudo mysql_secure_installation
Install PHP and Required Modules:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql -y
Restart Apache for PHP Integration:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart apache2
4. Test LAMP Installation
Create a PHP Info File:
Create a PHP file in the Apache web root directory to test PHP:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /var/www/html/info.php
Add the following line to the file:

php
Copy code
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
Save and Close the File (in Nano, it's Ctrl + X, then Y to confirm, and Enter to save).

Access the PHP Info File: Open a web browser and enter your EC2 instance's public IP address followed by /info.php (e.g., http://your-instance-public-ip/info.php). You should see the PHP info page displaying information about your PHP installation.

5. Additional Configuration (Optional)
Virtual Hosts: Set up virtual hosts in Apache to host multiple websites on the same server.
Firewall Configuration: Adjust firewall settings (ufw) if necessary to allow or restrict traffic.
Similarly to the Amazon Linux guide, this is a basic setup. For production environments or specific use cases, additional configurations and security measures may be needed. Always ensure you follow best practices for securing your server and applications.
